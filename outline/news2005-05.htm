            <h2>VEND LEASE + YOU = SUCCESS! </h2>
            <p>We must, once again, begin by thanking you for putting your confidence
              in Vend Lease.&nbsp; Your continued business referrals has rewarded
              us with an exceptional &quot;jump start&quot; in 2005.&nbsp; The
              saying &quot;Keep Those Cards and Letters Coming&quot; is appropriate
              here - We would just like to change it to &quot;Keep Those Credit
              Applications Coming!&quot;</p>
            <p>Our goal of providing the highest possible level of service remains
              at the forefront of our day to day process.&nbsp; Many enhancements
              to processing and the addition of new technology are the beginning
              stages of our commitment to assisting you in closing more deals.&nbsp; Our
              commitment does not stop there, however.&nbsp; We believe that
              the best way to continue to grow and achieve success is to invest
              in our associates.&nbsp; After all, developing associates that
              will take that extra step to please the customer is critical to
              any business's success.&nbsp; As a result, we continue to provide
              the tools and training necessary for our associates to perform
              at their best on a daily basis.&nbsp; With the implementation of
              new technology, we are in the process of working with a training
              facility to develop and implement a structured training program.&nbsp; The &quot;return
              on investment&quot; is immeasurable and realized by us, our customers
              and our customer's customers - the &quot;trickle down&quot; effect.</p>
            <h2>Bet You Didn't Know</h2>
            <p>Vend Lease allows easy &quot;add-on&quot; flexibility!&nbsp; If
              you find, after the initial sale, that your customer needs to add
              equipment, software, etc., our lease program provides an easy solution.&nbsp; Instead
              of having to execute another full lease, this &quot;add-on&quot; equipment
              can be wrapped into the existing lease with one easy document called
              a Lease Modification and it can be done at any time.&nbsp; So,
              the next time your customer needs additional equipment, software,
              etc. call us to see how easy this can be!</p>
            <p>We offer Pre-Funding! We can pre-fund on any deal.&nbsp; Just
              let your sales rep know when you or your customer submits the credit
              application.&nbsp; Your pre-fund is sent out immediately upon return
              of fully executed lease documents and a verbal from the customer.&nbsp; Call
              your sales rep to learn more about our Pre-Fund program!</p>

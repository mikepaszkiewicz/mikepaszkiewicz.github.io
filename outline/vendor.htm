      <h1>Vendor Benefits (content to be provided by Joe) </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast and Flexible Credit Decisions<br>
          We understand that time is money. We strive to communicate a decision to you within hours.</li>
        <li>Master Lease<br>
        Vend Lease is able to get you the equipment you need from multiple suppliers with one document. You select the Suppliers and we make the arrangements to pay each of them.</li>
        <li>&quot;Add-On&quot; Flexibility<br>
        If you find the need for additional equipment, Vend Lease allows you to add to your existing lease agreement at any time.</li>
        <li>Approvals of New Businesses<br>
        Our competitors look at them. We work to get them approved.</li>
        <li>Seasonal Payment Plans<br>
        Vend Lease can coordinate payment due dates with seasonal cash flow.</li>
        <li> &quot;Easy Lease&quot; Program<br>
        No Postage - No Late Charges - No Hassles_Forget about coupon books and writing checks. Monthly lease payments can be directly debited from a designated bank account on the agreed upon due date.</li>
        <li>Simple One Page Application<br>
        We realize how cumbersome it is to complete paperwork. Please refer to our &quot;Documents&quot; tab to download and print our standard credit application. If you prefer, we can fax an application. In cases where additional information is required (such as new business ventures or larger transactions), the necessary documents can be found on our &quot;Documents&quot; tab.</li>
        <li>No restrictions on NEW or USED Equipment<br>
        We can do one or the other or a combination of both.</li>
        <li>Competitive Terms<br>
        Vend Lease offers the most competitive terms in the industry.</li>
        <li>Less Documentation and Lower Initial Out of Pocket Expense<br>
          We are able to complete your equipment lease with less documentation and up front expense than a bank requires. Additionally, we do not require &quot;compensating balances&quot; required by most banks.</li>
        <li>Dedicated and Knowledgeable Support<br>
          Our associates are dedicated to providing the highest level of customer service.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>General advantages of leasing your equipment </h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Leasing Keeps Cash In Your Hands<br>
          You can obtain profit making new or used equipment immediately without touching your cash reserve.</li>
        <li>Leasing Preserves Your Established Credit Lines<br>
        Leasing extends the range of your credit facilities.</li>
        <li>Leasing Facilitates Budgeting and Hedges Against Inflation<br>
        The monthly rental of leased equipment is a fixed cost and can help you plan your priorities in your expansion or new business program. Many businesses have found that fixed monthly payments for leased equipment can fit into the tightest of budgets.</li>
        <li>Leasing May Offer Tax Advantages and Convenience<br>
          Lease payments may be 100% tax deductible as a business expense. (Please consult your tax advisor for individual tax advise)</li>
        <li>Leased Equipment Pays Its Own Way<br>
          Would you pay your employees four years in advance? That is what you are effectively doing when you purchase equipment. When you lease, you pay for the use of the equipment as it contributes to your profit.</li>

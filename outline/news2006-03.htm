            <h2>Trade Shows </h2>
            <p>We recently attended the following trade shows: </p>
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Hotel Motel &amp; Restaurant Supply Show of The Southeast in Myrtle      Beach, SC on January 24, 25 &amp; 26. This was a successful show allowing      us to make some new business contacts as well as spend some time with our      existing customers. It was great to see those of you who were there as      well. </li>
              <li>Mid-Atlantic Hospitality Technology Forum - Wilmington, DE. This      allowed us an opportunity to touch base with some of our existing lessees      and to solidify our relationships. It was great to receive positive      feedback from the actual restaurant owners. </li>
              <li>Chesapeake Automotive Business Association Snow Show - February 7,      2006 - Maryland State Fairgrounds </li>

            <h2>Singing Our Praises </h2>
            <p>Rick Malthaner from Creative Technical Solutions, Inc. (Philadelphia, PA) sent us these kind words: &ldquo;You guys are so easy to work with, from the initial app to the final payment.&rdquo;</p>
            <p>Glenn Paciaroni from B&amp;C Hospitality (N. Charleston, SC) had this to say about Vend Lease. &ldquo;At B&amp;C Hospitality, we have worked with over a dozen leasing companies over the last 7 years. Vend Lease by far is the best ever! Before, we used to have to constantly call the lease people to see where the deal was at or to ask for the check. With Vend Lease and especially Rob Wasson and Debbie Sigai, one call is all it takes. They follow up with us immediately and get the customer motivated to finish the deal. Within days we have a pre-fund check and they follow up as soon as the install is complete to get us the final payment. They have great rates and our customers enjoy working with them. Vend Lease is our first and primary leasing source! If they can't do the deal, then you probably don't want the customer in the long run.&rdquo;</p>

            <h2>The Vend Lease Advantage </h2>
            <p>We Approve more new businesses than our competition<br>
              Vend Lease is a direct lender - we are not a broker. As a result, we set the guidelines and make all of our own credit decisions. This, in turn, allows us to say Yes to more deals than our competition. What does that mean to you? You are able to close more deals.</p>

            <ul type="disc">
              <li>Fast and Flexible Credit Decisions </li>
              <li>We entertain start up businesses </li>
              <li>Pre-Funding Available </li>

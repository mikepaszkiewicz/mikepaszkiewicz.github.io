            <p>As September approaches and school gets back
            in session, Vend Lease gears up for a busy fall season.</p>
            <p>We welcomed July with a &quot;BANG&quot; and August started off &quot;SIZZLING&quot;.&nbsp; We
              realized quickly that, while some people choose to vacation during
              this time, others are busy opening and/or expanding their business.&nbsp; We
              expect the same in September.&nbsp; The applications are flowing
              at a steady rate, keeping us on our toes to meet the requests presented.&nbsp; Not
              to fear, however, our associates are definitely up for the challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Remember, Vend Lease offers add-on flexibility to existing leases.&nbsp; If
              you have a customer who has an existing lease with us and they
              need some additional equipment, send them our way.&nbsp; We can
              easily incorporate the additional equipment into their existing
              lease without extending the term.</p>
            <h2>Bet You Didn't Know&hellip;</h2>
            <p>As members of the Baltimore County Chamber of Commerce, Vend Lease
              and Blakefield Insurance are featured on a local cable television
              segment called &quot;Business Beat&quot;. We are excited about
              this opportunity and wanted to share it with all of our customers</p>
            <h2>Recent Transactions</h2>

            </ul>            <h2>Credit Corner</h2>
            <p>The goal of the Vend Lease Credit Department is to process credit
              requests in an effective and timely manner.&nbsp; When a customer
              completes an application, they are providing Vend Lease a snapshot
              of their business.&nbsp; Incomplete or omitted information will
              tend to slow down the process.&nbsp; If you are submitting the
              application on behalf of your customer, your contact with the customer
              is invaluable.&nbsp; Encourage them to complete the application
              in full so we can respond quickly to your requests.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that our credit applications can be found online
              at www.vendlease.net or you may contact our Sales Department and
              we can forward an application to your customer via e-mail or fax.&nbsp; Additionally,
              if you are interested in having us &quot;brand&quot; our credit
              applications with your name and logo, please contact Debbie Sigai

            <h2>We've Got You Covered</h2>
            <p><strong>Help Is On The Way For Healthcare Coverage</strong><br>
              With estimates of over
              40,000,000 un-insured Americans, we have a problem in our country.&nbsp; The soaring cost of quality health
              insurance prohibits many businesses from offering insurance to
              their employees.&nbsp; As a result, we all end up paying for the
              uninsured through hospitals, doctors, and insurance companies passing
              these costs onto us by charging higher premiums to those with insurance
              or through our tax dollars.&nbsp; The real solution is to find
              a way to pay for coverage without pushing the business owner out
              of the very business that is providing a much-needed job in the
              community.&nbsp; Help is on the way, however.&nbsp; A new concept
            is here:&nbsp; Voluntary Limited Benefit Plans.</p>
            <p>Imagine one of these scenarios: A 25 year old waiter is suddenly
              diagnosed with cancer or a 42 year old single mother is diagnosed
              with diabetes.&nbsp; In both cases, it is likely that these individuals
              either did not think they needed coverage or could not afford it.&nbsp; New
              voluntary limited medical programs are now available that can be
              offered at group rates with no contribution required from the employer.&nbsp; Some
              of these programs include preventive care, hospitalization benefits,
              a Prescription card, and even doctor visits.&nbsp; The premiums
              are as low as $16.00 a week for an employee, $25.00 a week for
              an employee and spouse, $23.00 a week for employee and Child or
              Children and $32.00 a week for Family.&nbsp; A 10% discount is
              also offered if the employer contributes at least $35.00 a month
              toward the coverage.&nbsp; In addition to the program being voluntary,
              it is also portable&mdash;you can take it with you if you leave
              your job.</p>
            <p>These programs are not intended to replace traditional medical
              coverage.&nbsp; Instead, the Limited Medical Plans are meant to
              fill a void by making medical insurance affordable for those who,
              in the past, may not have been in a position to purchase a full-blown
              medical plan.</p>
            <p>Blakefield Insurance Group has been approved to offer the &quot;Kelly
              Insurance Group Evergreen Program&quot; recently featured in news
              from the Restaurant Association.&nbsp; If you have interest in
              hearing more about this program, or to discuss other insurance
              options, please feel free to contact Mark M. Sucoloski, Managing
              Director at 410-325-8610 or e-mail at msucoloski@blakefieldinsurance.com

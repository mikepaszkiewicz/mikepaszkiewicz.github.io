            <h2>Recent Trade Shows</h2>
            <p>Vend Lease attended the Mid-Atlantic Expo held at the Baltimore Convention Center on September 7 &amp; 8. We always look forward to this show as it allows us to spend quality time with many of our existing customers. It was great to see everyone and we look forward to our next opportunity to get together.</p>
            <p>Vend Lease also attended the Florida Restaurant Show in Orlando on September 9, 10 &amp; 11. This particular show allowed us the opportunity to personally meet some of our existing customers for the first time-that in itself was worth the trip! We also made positive new contacts allowing us to expand and diversify our business opportunities.</p>
            <h2>Singing Our Praises</h2>
            <p>Stephanie Simmons from MICROS-Mid Atlantic had this to say about Vend Lease: &quot;'Simply the best!' That is what comes to mind when I think of Vend Lease. All of my customers that I have referred would agree.&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;In business, it is great to have vendors who can provide quality services and products, but when you can find true business partners who worry about your success and future, that's a home run. Vend Lease has continued to provide great support and commitment to our business and the businesses of our customers. Glad they are on our team&quot; Andrew Rill, Wirehead Business Technologies, President &amp; CEO</p>

            </ul>            <h2>&quot;We've Got You Covered&quot; Disability Insurance </h2>
            <p>Did you know that: the odds of dying are 1 out of 114, odds of having a fire are 1 out of 96, and odds of having a disabling accident are 1 out of 21 (taken from the National Safety Council, World Almanac; National Underwriter 2003 Field Guide)</p>
            <p>Some more statistics to make you think: A fatal injury occurs every five minutes and a disabling injury occurs every 1.5 seconds (National Safety Council, Injury Facts, 2003 Edition)</p>
            <p>1 in 10 people age 25 to 64 will suffer a disability (1994 Statistical Abstract of the U.S.) </p>
            <p>These statistics are meant to scare you into thinking about what you would do in the event of a disability to you or a loved one. </p>
            <p>We tend to insure our homes, cars, and businesses - but we neglect the one thing that provides the income to pay for all of those things - the ability to make a living. We even remember to buy life insurance in case of a death. Look back at the statistics and you will see that you are far more likely to experience a disability than death.</p>
            <p>A basic disability policy is designed to replace a certain percentage of your income for a period of time while you are disabled. The most common percentage is 66 2/3 of your pay. The premium is based on the amount of income you are trying to replace and the length of time that the insurance company will pay the benefit. For instance - you may have a policy that pays 66 2/3% of your pay for a total of 5 years or to age 65 for a Long Term disability policy. An example of a Short Term Disability policy could still have the same % of your pay but a shorter period of payments - maybe 13 weeks. Your disability must qualify for the benefit to start.</p>
            <p>Disability policies can be written for individuals or for employer groups. Employer plans can be very cost effective and compliment a benefit program. There are also insurance carriers that will offer disability plans on a voluntary basis so the employer does not have to contribute towards the cost of the plan - but the employees are given access to group rates.</p>
            <p>If you would like to discuss Disability or any other form of insurance, please fell free to call or email Mark M. Sucoloski, PAHM of Blakefield Insurance Group at 410-325-8610 or msucoloski@blakefieldinsurance.com </p>

              <li>Using Vend Lease Credit Applications Increases Sales. Did you
                know that you have more control over the speed at which your
                deals are approved?&nbsp; That's right, using a Vend Lease credit
                application will expedite the Credit Review Process.&nbsp; In
                many circumstances, a different application may not ask for information
                necessary to approve your customer.&nbsp; In this case, we may
                have to contact the customer directly to obtain this information.&nbsp; Busy
                customers are often hard to reach and this will slow the process
                down. </li>
              <li>Vend Lease can also prepare professional, customized credit
                applications with your company's name and logo.&nbsp; If you
                are interested please email Debbie Sigai @ dsigai@vendlease.net. </li>

            </ul>            <h2>We've Got You Covered</h2>
            <p>Imagine what would happen to your business if you or one of your
              partners would suddenly pass away.&nbsp; You may have taken steps
              to handle the personal situation of providing for your spouse or
              family - but what about the business.&nbsp; Can the business survive
              without you or the revenue you generate or the role you play in
              the success of the operation?&nbsp; If you are like most entrepreneurs
              - the answer is no.&nbsp; The real answer to this question is to
              take steps to protect the business through a life insurance product.</p>
            <p>Simply put, the business can purchase a life insurance policy
              on your life (or on the lives of each partner) in order to take
              care of the debts of the business upon your passing.&nbsp; At any
              given time, most businesses have outstanding debt -either inventory
              they have yet to pay for, outstanding accounts payable, or leased
              or rented equipment.&nbsp; A life insurance policy written for
              an amount to cover those costs can make the process less burdensome
              on your family, partners and attorneys.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
            <p>Another instance in which you may want to purchase life insurance
              is due to a &quot;Buy/Sell Agreements&quot; in partnerships.&nbsp; There
              are many reasons for a Buy/Sell agreement in a partnership.&nbsp; Buy-sell
              agreements can be used to prevent unwanted individuals from becoming
              owners of the business, and they can be used to ensure that the
              current owner group continues as the future owner group of the
              business. Buy-sell agreements can provide a market for the business
              interest that is to be sold and it can provide solutions for various
              unfavorable or unfortunate contingencies, such as the disability
              or the divorce of an owner. These agreements are also an invaluable
              tool for estate planning purposes.&nbsp; Life insurance can be
              a valuable tool for &quot;funding&quot; Buy/Sell Agreements.&nbsp; In
              other words - to be able to &quot;buy&quot; the shares of the deceased
              partner, the proceeds of a company purchased life insurance policy
              can be used to pay for those shares and keep the partnership intact.</p>

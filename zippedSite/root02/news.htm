We've Got You Covered
</p>

<p class = "contentParagraph">
We all know someone who has been “burnt” by identity theft—and we don’t think it can happen to us. The reality is that with the new information age we are all susceptible to identity theft. Nationwide can provide Identity Theft coverage for as little as $99 a year on a stand alone basis or $45 a year as part of your homeowners with Nationwide. It includes benefits like:
</p><br>

<p class="bulletSub">Costs of certified mail and long distance calls</p>
<p class="bulletSub">Costs of executing affidavits</p>
<p class="bulletSub">Lost income (max of $250 a day, total of $5,000)</p>
<p class="bulletSub">Loan Re-application fees</p>
<p class="bulletSub">Attorney’s fees</p>
<p class="bulletSub">24/7 phone assist through our partnership with “ID theft Assist”</p><br>

Vend Lease was founded in 1979 by Norbert & Raymond Paszkiewicz to provide equipment financing to the vending industry in the Mid-Atlantic region. More than a quarter of a century later, Vend Lease has changed dramatically and grown significantly. Today, Vend Lease is a general commercial equipment leasing company that underwrites business throughout the United States. We are a direct funding source, not a broker. Our customer base has a "main street" theme that ranges from the restaurant looking for a new POS System, additional kitchen equipment or Furniture & Fixtures to the local automotive repair shop which is upgrading their lifts or aligners to the convenience store that is in the market for a security system or refrigeration equipment. Additionally, Vend Lease provides financing to any commercial business for their office equipment or material handling needs and, in staying true to our roots, we are still a leading provider of financing to the vending industry.

Equipment Leasing for Hospitality, Automotive and Vending Industries
</p>

<p class = "contentParagraph">
We believe there are several contributing factors to our success that go hand in hand and are based on relationships. It starts with the energy of our associates. We are fortunate to have many dedicated associates whom we are very proud of. They enable Vend Lease to consistently offer the highest value in the industry. This, in turn, has built confidence in existing and prospective equipment suppliers to put their trust in Vend Lease to handle the financing needs of their customers. Additionally, we are also very fortunate to have many lessees return to Vend Lease for additional equipment needs as they arise. Our goal, each day, is to exceed our customer's expectations through consistent execution while holding ourselves to the highest levels of integrity and professionalism.

To remain competitive, we will continue to invest in our associates through training while investing in new technology to increase our efficiency and productivity. Most importantly, to remain competitive, we will continue to listen to our customers and associates and adapt accordingly while always holding firm to our Vision Statement.

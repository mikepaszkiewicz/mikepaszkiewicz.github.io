VEND LEASE + YOU = SUCCESS!
</p>


<p class = "contentParagraph">
We must, once again, begin by thanking you for putting your confidence in Vend Lease.  Your continued business referrals has rewarded us with an exceptional "jump start" in 2005.  The saying "Keep Those Cards and Letters Coming" is appropriate here - We would just like to change it to "Keep Those Credit Applications Coming!"
<br><br>
Our goal of providing the highest possible level of service remains at the forefront of our day to day process.  Many enhancements to processing and the addition of new technology are the beginning stages of our commitment to assisting you in closing more deals.  Our commitment does not stop there, however.  We believe that the best way to continue to grow and achieve success is to invest in our associates.  After all, developing associates that will take that extra step to please the customer is critical to any business's success.  As a result, we continue to provide the tools and training necessary for our associates to perform at their best on a daily basis.  With the implementation of new technology, we are in the process of working with a training facility to develop and implement a structured training program.  The "return on investment" is immeasurable and realized by us, our customers and our customer's customers - the "trickle down" effect.

<p class="subHeading">
Bet You Didn't Know
</p>

<p class = "contentParagraph">
Vend Lease allows easy "add-on" flexibility!  If you find, after the initial sale, that your customer needs to add equipment, software, etc., our lease program provides an easy solution.  Instead of having to execute another full lease, this "add-on" equipment can be wrapped into the existing lease with one easy document called a Lease Modification and it can be done at any time.  So, the next time your customer needs additional equipment, software, etc. call us to see how easy this can be!
<br><br>
We offer Pre-Funding! We can pre-fund on any deal.  Just let your sales rep know when you or your customer submits the credit application.  Your pre-fund is sent out immediately upon return of fully executed lease documents and a verbal from the customer.  Call your sales rep to learn more about our Pre-Fund program!
